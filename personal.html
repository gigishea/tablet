		<img src="images/about.png" alt="Giselle posing on a couch, smiling" id="aboutme">

		<p> I am 20 years old, and have one younger brother who is 18. I grew up in New York my whole life, but my mom’s side of the family is from Michigan, which is how I ended up in the Mitten State!
            <br>I am very passionate about music and writing. I actually write for The Michigan Daily’s Music Beat, a perfect combination for me! I also do a lot of creative writing in my free time, and am a part of multiple writing organizations on campus.
           <br> I have the best dog in the whole world, Thor, a five year old corgi. I miss him at all times!
		   <br> I love seeing new places, and I’m working in Chicago this summer, which will be super new and exciting!</p>
		   <img src="images/mets.jpg" alt="Giselle and her father in Mets gear" id='nymets'>
		   <p> I have been a lifelong fan of the New York Mets. When I'm not watching baseball games, I really enjoy going to concerts.
		   <br> My favorite musicians are Taylor Swift, One Direction, Frank Ocean, and many more.
            <br>Check out my <a href= "scrapbook.html">scrapbook</a> for pictures of these parts of my life!</p>
